# Integrate a Weather API

The OpenWeatherMap platform has an API that includes a free tier. This allows you to write programs on your connected devices that can fetch current weather data for any location. First, you'll need to sign up to get your API key.

Visit:

It may show your location by default. If not, you be able to search for it.

Sign up for an account and log in - and select `API` from the menu:

Select `Currente Weather Data` - and press `Subscribe`

Press `Get API Key` - and generate a Key:

Perhaps giving it a name.

Before testing the key - have a quick look here:

In particular - look at the question:

- Do I need to activate my API key?

You key will be activated automatically in between 10 minutes & 2 hours! However, < 10 minutes seems typical
