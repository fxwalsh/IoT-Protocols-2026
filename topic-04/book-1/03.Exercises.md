## Exercises & Research

a. How does the reading vary with high and low light(or direction of potentiometer adjustment)?
b. How would you change the the code to display values from the third channel of the MPC3006?
c. You might see  non-zero values in channels that don't have anything connected? How could you modify the circuit for better
presentation?

d. The following statements from the program compute the digital value displayed:
~~~python
	...
    adc = spi.xfer2([1, (8 + channel) << 4, 0])
    data = ((adc[1] & 3) << 8) + adc[2]
    ...
~~~


Use the web to investigate, understand and explain their function.

d. The resistor is used as a  "pull down" resistor in the circuit. What does this mean?
