# Connecting to your Arduino
The Arduino needs to be connected to your laptop/PC via a USB in order to upload compiled programs from the IDE

+ Connect your Arduino MKR 1010 board to your computer using the micro USB cable that comes with the kit. 
+ If not already running, launch the Arduino IDE
+ The IDE should detect the connected board. In the Header, select `Arduino MRK Wifi 1010` in the device dropdown. It should look something like this:
  ![image-20231026144534830](./img/image-20231026144534830.png)

If you **don't** see the board in the dropdown list, try the following

+ Go to `Tools` > `Board` and select `Arduino MKR WiFi 1010`.
+ Go to `Tools` > `Port` and select the port that your Arduino MKR 1010 is connected to.

If this does not work, try closing the IDE, disconnecting/reconnecting the board, and then opening the IDE again.
