# Lab - Programming the Raspberry Pi
Python . Rpi
### Overview

This lab will introduce you to programming on the Raspberry Pi using the Python. The lab is split into two parts: 

### **Part 1** - SenseHAT Exploration using Python

Use the various sensors on the Sense HAT, gaining basic understanding of how to read sensor data using the Python programming language on the Raspberry Pi.

### Part 2 - Raspberry Pi Sensor

Enhance the Smart Sensor use case explored in the [week7 lab](https://tutors.dev/lab/setu-hdip-comp-sci-2024-comp-sys/topic-07-week7/unit-1/book-b) by replacing the simulated smart sensor with the Raspberry Pi as a prototype. 



#### Objectives

- Understand the purpose of each sensor on the Sense HAT
- Write Python code to access data from each sensor
- Display sensor data in a simple, readable format

+ Write a reusable Python module that  retrieves sensor data from a SenseHAT using Python

+ Write a Python program that sends Environmental data to a server
