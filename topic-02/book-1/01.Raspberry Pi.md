Set Up ·Secure Shell Connection · Sensor Readings



The [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org) is a single-board computer. You can add sensors and actuators using a wide range of devices and ecosystems, and for these lessons using a hardware ecosystem called [Grove](https://www.seeedstudio.com/category/Grove-c-1003.html). You will code your Pi and access the Grove sensors using Python.

## Setup

If you are using a Raspberry Pi as your IoT hardware, you have two choices - you can work through all these lessons and code directly on the Pi, or you can connect remotely to a 'headless' Pi and code from your computer.

Before you begin, you also need to connect the Grove Base Hat to your Pi.

### Task - setup

Install the Grove base hat on your Pi and configure the Pi

1. Connect the Grove base hat to your Pi. The socket on the hat fits over all of the GPIO pins on the Pi, sliding all the way down the pins to sit firmly on the base. It sits over the Pi, covering it.

### Remote access to code the Pi

Rather than coding directly on the Pi, it can run 'headless', that is not connected to a keyboard/mouse/monitor, and configure and code on it from your computer, using Visual Studio Code.

#### Set up the Pi OS

To code remotely, the Pi OS needs to be installed on an SD Card.

##### Task - set up the Pi OS

Set up the headless Pi OS.

1. Download the **Raspberry Pi Imager** from the [Raspberry Pi OS software page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and install it

1. Insert an SD card into your computer, using an adapter if necessary

1. Launch the Raspberry Pi Imager

1. From the Raspberry Pi Imager, select the **CHOOSE OS** button, then select *Raspberry Pi OS (Other)*, followed by *Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy 32-bit) Lite Bullseye* . **Make sure you choose the LITE version and BULLSEYE**

    > 💁 Raspberry Pi OS Lite is a version of Raspberry Pi OS that doesn't have the desktop UI or UI based tools. These aren't needed for a headless Pi and makes the install smaller and boot up time faster.

1. Click Choose Storage. You should see your SD Card in the list. Select your SD card from the list.

1. When prompted to apply OS customisation, select "EDIT SETTINGS". This will allow you to configure Wifi, login, and Secure Shell (SSH)

1. In the general tab, set you hostname to be something unique and memorable - like "RPiFrank". Also, set you username and password to something memorable (don't forget this or you'll have to do it all again.) . And set your Wifi settings to **what is given to you in class** (SSID is the wifi name and password - IT IS ALL CASE SENSITIVE). 
    It is important to do this correctly if you are connecting with the "Headless" approach.

+ Click "Save", an then "Yes" when prompted to apply OS customisation settings. You my be asked if it's OK to overwrite the SD card -
   it is OK.

+ The imager should now begin writing the OS to the SD card



The OS will be written to the SD card, and once complete the card will be ejected by the OS, and you will be notified. Remove the SD card from your computer, insert it into the Pi, power up the Pi and wait for about 2 mins for it to properly boot.

#### Connect to the Pi

The next step is to remotely access the Pi. You can do this using `ssh`, which is available on macOS, Linux and recent versions of Windows.

##### Task - connect to the Pi

Remotely access the Pi.

1. Launch a Terminal or Command Prompt, and enter the following command to connect to the Pi(replace *username* and *yourhostname* with what you used in the last step:

    ```sh
    ssh username@yourhostname.local
    ```

    If you are on Windows using an older version that doesn't have `ssh` installed, you can use OpenSSH. You can find the installation instructions in the [OpenSSH installation documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com//windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).

![image-20250203155515546](./img/01.01/image-20250203155515546.png)

1. This should connect to your Pi and ask for the password.

    Being able to find computers on your network by using `<hostname>.local` is a fairly recent addition to Linux and Windows. If you are using Linux or Windows and you get any errors about the Hostname not being found, you will need to install additional software to enable ZeroConf networking (also referred to by Apple as Bonjour):

    1. If you are using Linux, install Avahi using the following command:

        ```sh
        sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
        ```

    1. If you are using Windows, the easiest way to enable ZeroConf is to install [Bonjour Print Services for Windows](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999). You can also install [iTunes for Windows](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) to get a newer version of the utility (which is not available standalone).

    > 💁 If you cannot connect using `raspberrypi.local`, then you can use the IP address of your Pi. Refer to the [Raspberry Pi IP address documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md) for instructions on a number of ways to get the IP address.

1. Enter the password you set in the Raspberry Pi Imager Advanced Options

#### Configure software on the Pi

Once you are connected to the Pi, you need to ensure the OS is up to date, and install various libraries and tools that interact with the Grove hardware.

##### Task - configure software on the Pi

Configure the installed Pi software and install the Grove libraries.

1. From your `ssh` session, run the following command to update then reboot the Pi:

    ```sh
    sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade --yes && sudo reboot
    ```

    The Pi will be updated and rebooted. The `ssh` session will end when the Pi is rebooted, so leave it for about 30 seconds then reconnect.

1. From the reconnected `ssh` session, run the following commands to install all the needed libraries for the Grove hardware:

    ```sh
    sudo apt install git python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip --yes
    
    mkdir temperature-sensor
    cd te*
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source ./.venv/bin/activate
    git clone https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/grove.py
    cd grove.py
    sudo pip3 install .
    
    sudo raspi-config nonint do_i2c 0
    ```

    This starts by installing Git, along with Pip to install Python packages.

    One of the powerful features of Python is the ability to install [Pip packages](https://pypi.org) - these are packages of code written by other people and published to the Internet. You can install a Pip package onto your computer with one command, then use that package in your code.

    The Seeed Grove Python packages need to be installed from source. These commands will clone the repo containing the source code for this package, then install it locally.

    > 💁 By default when you install a package it is available everywhere on your computer, and this can lead to problems with package versions - such as one application depending on one version of a package that breaks when you install a new version for a different application. To work around this problem, you can use a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), essentially a copy of Python in a dedicated folder, and when you install Pip packages they get installed just to that folder. 

    Finally, this enables the I<sup>2</sup>C interface.

1. Reboot the Pi by running the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo reboot
    ```

    The `ssh` session will end when the Pi is rebooted. There is no need to reconnect.

#### Configure VS Code for remote access

Once the Pi is configured, you can connect to it using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) from your computer - this is a free developer text editor you will be using to write your device code in Python.

##### Install and Configure Remote SSH in VS Code

1. Open **VS Code** on your computer.
2. Install the **Remote - SSH** extension:
   - Go to **Extensions** (`Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS).
   - Search for **Remote - SSH** and install it.

##### Add the Raspberry Pi to SSH Configuration (Optional)

1. Open the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS).

2. Type **Remote-SSH: Open SSH Configuration File** and select it.

3. Choose your user SSH config file - usually the 1st in the list (`~/.ssh/config`).

4. Add the following entry, replacing the hostname and user as indicated:

   ```sh
   Host raspberrypi
       HostName <YOUR_RPi_HOSTNAME>
       User <YOUR_USERNAME>
   ```

5. Save the file.

##### Connect to the Raspberry Pi in VS Code

1. Open the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`).
2. Type **Remote-SSH: Connect to Host** and select it.
3. Enter the hostname or IP address of the Raspberry Pi (or select it if configured in `~/.ssh/config`).
4. If prompted, enter your SSH password for the Raspberry Pi.
5. Once connected, open a folder or workspace on the Pi.

##### Set Up Passwordless SSH (Optional)

To avoid entering a password every time, set up SSH key authentication:

1. On your computer, generate an SSH key (if not already created):

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
   ```

2. Copy the public key to the Raspberry Pi:

   ```sh
   ssh-copy-id pi@<Raspberry_Pi_IP>
   ```

3. Now, you can connect without a password.

##### Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails, ensure:

  - The Raspberry Pi is powered on and connected to the network.
  - SSH is enabled (`sudo systemctl status ssh`).
  - The IP address is correct.
  - Your firewall or security settings allow SSH.

- For permission issues, try:

  ```sh
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

Now you should be able to code and manage your Raspberry Pi remotely from VS Code! 🚀

## Hello world

It is traditional when starting out with a new programming language or technology to create a 'Hello World' application - a small application that outputs something like the text `"Hello World"` to show that all the tools are correctly configured.

The Hello World app for the Pi will ensure that you have Python and Visual Studio code installed correctly.

This app will be in a folder called `nightlight`, and it will be re-used with different code in later parts of this assignment to build the nightlight application.

### Task - hello world

Create the Hello World app.

1. Launch VS Code, either directly on the Pi, or on your computer and connected to the Pi using the Remote SSH extension

1. Launch the VS Code Terminal by selecting *Terminal -> New Terminal, or pressing `` CTRL+SHIFT+' ``. It will open your home directory.

1. Run the following commands to create a directory for your code, and create a Python file called `app.py` inside that directory:

    ```sh
    
    cd temperature-sensor
    touch app.py
    ```

    Or do this using the file editor in VS code.

    Open this folder in VS Code by selecting *File -> Open...* and selecting the *temperature-sensor* folder, then select **OK**

    <img src="./img/01.01/image-20250205122102827.png" alt="image-20250205122102827" style="zoom:50%;" />

1. Open the `app.py` file from the VS Code explorer and add the following code:

    ```python
    print('Hello World!')
    ```

    The `print` function prints whatever is passed to it to the console.

1. From the VS Code Terminal, run the following to run your Python app:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

    > 💁 You may need to explicitly call `python3` to run this code if you have Python 2 installed in addition to Python 3 (the latest version). If you have Python2 installed then calling `python` will use Python 2 instead of Python 3. By default, the latest Raspberry Pi OS versions only have Python 3 installed.

    The following output will appear in the terminal:

    ```output
    pi@raspberrypi:~/nightlight $ python3 app.py
    Hello World!
    ```
