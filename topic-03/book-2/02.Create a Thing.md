#### Add the security camera to the network.

You need to add a network adapter to the security camera so that it can connect to a network. 

+ Click on the **Advanced** button and then click on the **I/O Config tab.** In the I/O Config window change the **Network Adapter dropdown menu** to the **PT-IOT-NM-1W** adapter. This is a wireless(Wifi) adapter . Attach the security camera to the network.
