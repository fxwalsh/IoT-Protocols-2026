# Raspberry Pi Wi‑Fi Setup for Labs

This guide explains how to configure your Raspberry Pi's Wi‑Fi by placing a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file on the boot partition. Follow these steps:

------

## 1. Power Down and Remove the SD Card

Shut down your Raspberry Pi and remove its microSD card to ensure a safe modification of the boot partition.

## 2. Insert the SD Card into Your Computer

Insert the microSD card into your computer. The boot partition (formatted as FAT32) should appear automatically.

## 3. Create the `wpa_supplicant.conf` File

In the root directory of the boot partition, create a new file named exactly `wpa_supplicant.conf`.

## 4. Edit the File with Your Network Details

Open the file in a text editor and paste the following content. Pick the one for your assigned router:

#### Router 1

```
country=ie
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="Three_086D2C"
    psk="2uJvV8X5n328p85"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

#### Router 2

```
country=ie
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid="Three_086A54"
    psk="2yLhrRsE7Y5wJYA"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

- Replace `YOUR_WIFI_SSID` with the name of your wireless network.
- Replace `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD` with your network password.
- The `country=IE` line sets the country to Ireland.

## 5. Save and Safely Eject the SD Card

Save the file and safely eject the microSD card from your computer.

## 6. Reinsert and Boot Up Your Raspberry Pi

Place the microSD card back into your Raspberry Pi and power it up. On the first boot, the system will detect the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file in the boot partition, move it to the appropriate location, and configure your Wi‑Fi settings automatically.
