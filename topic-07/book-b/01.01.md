In this exercise we will be using two Firebase services: Realtime Database and Storage

## Create a Firebase Project

+  Open the Firebase console and create a new project called *SenseArd*. 
+  Click *Continue* and disable *Google Analytics*

After your project is ready, you can create a Realtime Database. 

## Setting up Realtime Database

With Firebase Realtime Database, clients connect to the database and have a bidirectional connection using HTTP websockets. Then if any client pushes data to the database it will inform all connected clients that it has been changed by sending them the newly saved data.

This is similar to a MQTT broker and how it reacts when it receives a message from a publisher and sends it to all subscribers. The difference, unlike MQTT, is that the data is stored in the database also.

Set up the Realtime Database as follows:

+  In your *SensePi* Project, select *Realtime Database* and then *Create Database*

+  Select "europe-west1" for the location.
+  For Security Rules, Select the *Start in Test Mode* option and click *Enable*.

+ You should now see the *Data* of the Database, which is empty.

You have now set up the Realtime DB for tracking events. The next step is to use the Firebase Arduino Library to write a program on the Arduino to create a button "Events" in the DB every time a button is pressed on the carrier.
