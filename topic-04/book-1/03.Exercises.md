## Exercises & Research

a. How does the reading vary with high and low light?
b. How would you change the wiring and code to display light value in third column of the terminal for ADS1115?
c. Explain the reasons for seeing non-zero values in columns 1-3 of the terminal for the code provided in ADS1115? How would you modify it for better
presentation?
d. The resistor used as a pull up resistor in one circuit, and pull down resistor in the other circuit. Comment on the pros and cons.

1. Update the python code for MCP3008 ADC to display light intensity value at a rate of 5 Hz.
2. Implement a moving average filter (n=4) to display the light intensity value at a rate of 2 Hz.
