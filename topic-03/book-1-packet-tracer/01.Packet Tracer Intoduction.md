# Create a Simple Network Using Packet Tracer

Packet Tracer · Network Device Configuration · Network Simulation

In this lab you will create a simple network simulation in Packet Tracer. 
We will try to simulate a simple home network and save the simulation as a packet tracer file (.pkt).

## Objectives

+ Build a Simple Home Network in Packet Tracer using the Logical Topology Workspace
+ Configure Network Devices
+ Test Connectivity between Network Devices
+ Manage Packet Tracer files

## Prerequisites:

+ Cisco Packet Tracer
+ Internet Connection
+ Ideally, complete the previous lab!
