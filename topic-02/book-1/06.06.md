# SenseHAT

In this step you will mount the SenseHAT and run a simple program that uses the SenseHAT to take a temperature reading and make a simple decision (too hot, fine, too cold).

## Before We Start...

...lets make sure the RPi is up to date. In the RPi SSH session, run the following commands:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
This will download package information and install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system.

## Attach the SenseHAT

Never attach/remove the senseHAT while the RPi is powered up. Never attach/remove the senseHAT while the RPi is powered up (it's worth saying that twice that before we go on!).

To attach the SenseHAT, follow the guide [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/2)

## Configure the RPi for SenseHAT

- Power up the RPi with the SenseHAT attached. You may notice all the LEDs come on and stay on  - that's ok for now. 

- Start a SSH session on you Raspberry Pi. You can probably use the host name you configured in the last step now instead of the IP address.

### Install SenseHAT package

- Type this command into the terminal to install the Sense HAT package:

```bash
sudo apt-get install sense-hat
```

- Now reboot the RPi by entering ``sudo reboot`` in the SSH session. You will lose connection immediately. 

**Only if the LEDs stay on after the reboot**, enter the following command

```shell
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
+ Scroll to the bottom of the file and append the following line(do not use any spaces around the "=" sign, enter it exactly as below):

```shell
dtoverlay=rpi-sense
```

+ Now press *Ctrl - O*, followed by *Enter* to Save. Then *Ctrl - X* to quit.

+ Reboot the RPi again as above. The LEDs should turn off after the boot process has completed. 

## Create your 1st Python Program

- Create a new directory called ``week6-lab2`` and change directory to it:

~~~bash
pi@sensePi:~ $ mkdir week7-lab1
pi@sensePi:~ $ cd week7*
pi@sensePi:~/week7-lab1 $
~~~

- Using nano, create a new python script called ``temp-sensor.py`` and add the following code:

```python
from sense_hat import SenseHat

sense = SenseHat()
sense.clear()
green = (0, 255, 0)
red = (255,0,0)
while True:
  temp = sense.get_temperature()
  if temp >=25:
    sense.show_message("HOT!", text_colour = red)
  else:
    sense.show_message("Fine!", text_colour = green)
  print(temp)

```

- Now run the the program by typing ``python temp-sensor.py`` at the command line. You should see output similar to the following:

~~~bash
~/cs-lab-5 $ python temp-sensor.py
33.149307251
33.1675720215
33.2771759033
33.3319740295
~~~

and your SenseHAT should be telling you if it's HOT! or Fine.

Look at the code and try to understand the logic using what you learned in Programming. Some things of note with Python

1. You use indent group statements in a program or script. For example, notice the  block of code contained in the ``while`` statement is indented.
2. You don't have to compile it before you run it - it's an 'interpreted' language.
3. Python is dynamically typed; you don't have to declare what type each variable is.  

# Exercises 

- Change the above code and set the temperature threshold so that it changes the output on the SenseHAT(i.e. if it's ``HOT!``, make it display ``Fine``).
- Notice how ``red`` and ``green`` variables are declared. Investigate and explain why.
- Change the program to display everything in blue.
- The temperature you're seeing is probably way off the ambient temp (certainly wasn't 33 Celsius when I tested it for this lab!) . Why do you think this is the case. Propose a solution to correcting this problem and implement it, if possible, in code.
