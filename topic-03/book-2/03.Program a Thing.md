function setup() {
	setState(state);
}

function mouseEvent(pressed, x, y, firstPress) {
	setState(HIGH);
}

function loop() {
	if ( state == HIGH ) {
		current_time--;
		if ( current_time <= 0 )
			setState(LOW);
	}
	delay(1000);
}

function setState(newState) {
	state = newState;
	if (state === LOW) {
		digitalWrite(1, LOW);
	} else {
