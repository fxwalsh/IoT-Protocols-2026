The Arduino IDE provides a set of core libraries and a framework that make it easier  to write code for microcontroller-based projects without needing a deep knowledge of C++ or microcontroller-specific programming.\r\n\r\nAn Arduino sketch contains two main functions:\r\n\r\n1. `setup()`: This function is run once when the board starts up. It's used for initialization tasks.\r\n2. `loop()`: This function runs continuously after the `setup()` function completes.

Please be careful and always disconnect your Arduino board from power supply(i.e. pull out the USB cable) before connecting anything to it. \r\n\r\nThe MKR IoT Carrier is a \"Hardware Attached on Top\" (HAT) device for the Arduino MKR boards. It combines sensors, LEDs,  relay circuits and a display in one device and allows the developer to  focus on prototyping and programming  projects.\r\n<img src=\"./img/ABX00073_03.front_50ef226c-7f39-47ec-8161-4d62cf3855a8_934x700.jpg\" alt=\"Arduino MKR IoT Carrier Rev2\" style=\"zoom:33%;\" />\r\n\r\n### Mounting Board on the MKR IoT Carrier\r\n\r\nThe Arduino MKR 1010  board needs to be mounted on top of the MKR IoT Carrier Rev2. The board can be connected as shown in the image below, matching the pin numbers on the board to the ones on the carrier. Make sure you have it the right way around!\r\n\r\n+ Line up the pins, matching the pin numbers on the board to the ones on the carrier, and push the board down into the Header socket.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n![Mounting board on the MKR IoT Carrier Rev2](./img/mkr-mount.png)\r\n\r\n+ Connect your Arduino to the computer. You should see the greed \"PWR\" LED light up on the Carrier board.\r\n\r\n### Programming\r\n\r\nTo program the MKR IoT Carrier Rev2, the Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier library needs to be included. This library allows us to control and read all the components of the MKR IoT Carrier Rev2.\r\n\r\n#### Add Library to Arduino IDE\r\n\r\n+ In the Arduino IDE, go to the menu bar and click on Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...\r\n\r\n+ The Library Manager will open. In the search box (upper right), type `Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier`.\r\n\r\n+ Once the Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier library appears in the search results, select it.\r\n\r\n+ You'll see an Install button on the right side.

The code used in the initialisation and setup is rarely changed, and it is required in every sketch. See the following example for flashing the LEDs on the Board:\r\n\r\n+ Copy the following code into the Arduino IDE. \r\n\r\n````cpp\r\n/*\r\n  Blinks the LEDs on the MKR Carrier Rev2\r\n*/\r\n#include <Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier.h> \t//the Arduino_MKRIoTCarrier library needs to be included\r\nMKRIoTCarrier carrier; \t\t\t\t//an object of type MKRIoTCarrier is created\r\n\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n  carrier.begin();\t\t\t\t\t//initialises the Carrier board for use.\r\n}\r\nint red = 0, green = 0, blue = 255;  // RGB values of light\r\nint ledColour = carrier.leds.Color(red, green, blue); //create colour to display on LEDs\r\n\r\nvoid loop() {\r\n  carrier.leds.fill(ledColour); \t//Set all LEDs to blue\r\n  carrier.leds.show(); \t\t\t\t//update the new state of the LEDs \r\n  delay(1000);  \t\t\t\t\t// Pause 1000 milliseconds (1 second)\r\n  carrier.leds.fill(0); \t\t\t//Set all LEDs to no colour(off)\r\n  carrier.leds.show(); \t\t\t\t//update the new state of the LEDs \r\n  delay(1000);\t\t\t\t\t\t// Pause 1000 milliseconds (1 second)\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nCompile/Upload to the board as before. The LEDs should blink on and off every second (1Hz).\r\nAgain, review this code and understand the logic by reading the comments. Try the following by making changes to the code:\r\n\r\n+ Change the colour to Red\r\n+ Change the blink rate to 0.5 seconds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","route":"/lab/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-02/unit-1/book-2/05","id":"05"},{"title":" Carrier Examples and Cheat Sheet","shortTitle":"06","contentMd":"# Carrier Examples and Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\n### MKR IoT Carrier Rev2 Cheat Sheet\r\n\r\nGo [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/mkr-iot-carrier-rev2/cheat-sheet) to learn how to set up and use the MKR IoT Carrier Rev2.\r\n\r\nIf you scroll down, you will see some example code that you can try out.\r\n\r\n### IDE Examples\r\n\r\nThe Arduino IDE includes example sketches for the MKR Carrier.

It has no desktop. **If you wish, you can install the full version if you intend to the desktop and operate it as a \"regular\" computer.**\r\n  \r\n+ Click Choose Storage. You should see your SD Card in the list.

This will allow you to configure Wifi, login, and Secure Shell (SSH)\r\n  \r\n+ In the general tab, set you hostname to \"HDipRPi\", username and password to something memorable (don't forget this or you'll have to do it all again.) . And set your Wifi settings to whatever you have at home (SSID is your wifi network name and password - IT IS CASE SENSITIVE). \r\n  It is important to do this correctly if you are connecting with the \"Headless\" approach. \r\n  <img src=\"./img/image-20231026122813610.png\" alt=\"image-20231026122813610\" style=\"zoom: 33%;\" />\r\n\r\n+ Select the Services tab and enable SSH to on and select \"Use password authentication.\" \r\n<img src=\"./img/image-20231026122909743.png\" alt=\"image-20231026122909743\" style=\"zoom: 33%;\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+ Click \"Save\", an then \"Yes\" when prompted to apply OS customisation settings. You my be asked if it's OK to overwrite the SD card - it is.\r\n\r\n+ The imager should now begin writing the OS to the SD card\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Boot the Pi\r\n\r\n- Eject the SD card and put it into the unplugged RPi. \r\n- Now power up the RPi - it should automatically connect to the the WiFi network. But how do you know if it's connected? You'll have to find it on the local network...\r\n\r\n## Exercise\r\n\r\nBefore moving on, try to come up with your own solution to finding and connecting to the RPi. If everything has worked out so far you now know the following: \r\n\r\n+ The host name is \"HDipRpi\"(or whatever you configured it to be)\r\n+ the RPi should have acquired an IP address on the same local network as your computer (**Make sure your computer is connected to the same network as your RPi!**)\r\n+ It's configured for SSH\r\n+ All RPis have the same manufacturers MAC address section, so the MAC will start with \"``b8:27:eb:`` or ``dc:a6:32:``\"  \r\n\r\nThere is more than one solution to this problem. Based on what we've covered in the Module so far, see if you can come up with more than one before moving on...","route":"/lab/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-02/unit-1/book-3/01","id":"01"},{"title":" Where's my RPi?","shortTitle":"03","contentMd":"# Where's my RPi?\r\nSo to use the RPi in headless mode, you will need to find its IP address. To do this, we'll use the fact that we know the host name and the MAC address pattern. Here are a few solutions you can try(you need only pick one):\r\n\r\n## 1. Use MAC address\r\nFrom week 4 you know that the first 3 bytes of the MAC address is the [OUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizationally_unique_identifier) and indicates the manufacturer/source of the device. In this case, for the Pi it will be either ``b8:27:eb:...`` or ``dc:a6:32:...``.  \r\nSo one thing you can do is build up the arp cache on your computer by pinging every possible IP address on your network. If we do this, then the ARP table on your machine should contain the RPi MAC. Remember we used ``nmap`` from week4, lab1 too \"see\" the devices on your LAN. We can repeat the search to get a list, hopefully with the RPi in it:\r\n\r\n- On the command line, run the following command replacing ``<YOUR_NETWORK>`` with the correct Network and subnet mask for your LAN (check it using ipconfig/ifconfig, probably be something like ``192.168.0.0/24``).  \r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\nnmap -sn <YOUR_NETWORK>\r\n~~~\r\nYou should get a result similar to the following with the MAC and associated IP addresses. \r\n\r\n![nmap pi search](./img/nmap.png)\r\n\r\nLocate and record the RPi IP address.(it may take a while for the RPi to boot so try again if it's not there initially)\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Use the router \r\nIf you have administrator rights to your home router and can access the router management page then there usually is a facility to list all connected devices, including their host name and MAC address. As there are many home routers out there, how you access the network connection data will differ in each case.\r\n\r\n## 3. Do it your own way\r\n\r\nThere are other tools and techniques for finding devices on a network.

For this to work, **you must have a bridging network adapter configured on the CompSys2021 VM - see week 5 lab 1**. However, the process is the same for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows10, If you wish to SSH in from older Windows version, see the final section in this step: \r\n\r\n### SSH Connection\r\n\r\nTo connect to your Pi from Linux or MAC OSX, enter the following command into a terminal and replace \\<IP> with the IP address of the RPi and \\<username> with the user name you configured the OS with in a previous step.\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\nssh <username>@<IP>\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf you receive a connection timed out error it is likely that you have entered the wrong IP address for the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nWhen the connection works you will see a security/authenticity warning. Type  ***yes*** to continue. You will only see this warning the first time you connect.\r\n\r\n>  **Note:** You may be given a warning and asked to clear the record from your list of known devices. Accept this instruction and trying the ssh command again should be successful.\r\n\r\nNext you will be prompted for the password you entered in the previous step (I told you to remember it!)\r\n\r\nThe following image shows what a successful connection looks like(the ip address you use will be different):\r\n\r\n![SSH connection from Linux(CompSys VM)](./img/ssh.png)\r\n\r\nYou should now have the Raspberry Pi prompt:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\nusername@HDipRPi:~ $\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYou have now started a Secure Shell session on the Rpi, and can remotely execute commands on the RPi .\r\n\r\n## Connection Problems\r\n\r\nA connection might be unsuccessful for various reasons. If you get a network connection error or connection time out, always check the *physical* first - is it turned on and is the red led on!? If you're wireless, check that you have the correct IP address for the RPi by pinging it. If the ping replies successfully then it may be the case that you have not enabled/disabled SSH on the RPi. Power down the RPi and repeat the **Enable SSH section** in the Raspberry Pi OS Configuration page of this lab. \r\n\r\n Also, remember that the the IP address of the RPi can change if it uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol(DHCP). It'll usually keep the same IP for some time however you may need to find and update the IP address if this happens.\r\n\r\nFor Windows you will need to get a suitable 3rd party client. Please follow the instructions for your particular OS:\r\n\r\n## SSH from Windows <10 \r\nA popular SSH client for windows is called PuTTY.  Download and install the relevant windows installer from  [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html). \r\n\r\nRun PuTTY and type the IP address of your RPi into the Host Name field and click the Open button.  \r\n![PuTTY](./img/putty1.png)  \r\n\r\nWhen the connection works you will see the security warning shown below. Click the 'Yes' button. You will only see this warning the first time PuTTY connects to a RPi.  \r\n![PuTTY](./img/putty2.png) \r\n\r\nYou will now see the login prompt. The default login for Raspberry Pi OS is ``pi`` with the password ``raspberry``.\r\n\r\nYou should now have the Raspberry Pi prompt:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\nfrank@HDipRPi:~ $\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nYou are now connected to the Pi remotely, and can execute commands.\r\n\r\n### Ongoing use of Putty\r\n\r\nNext time you use PuTTY, look for the **Saved Sessions** section in the bottom half of the configuration screen. If you use this, it is recommended to switch to the  **Connection** page in the left hand tree, and setting the  **Seconds** between keepalives value to **30**. Then switch back to the  Session page in the tree before you click Save. Using this setting allows you to leave a PuTTY window open for long periods of time with no activity, without the Pi timing out and disconnecting you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","route":"/lab/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-02/unit-1/book-3/04","id":"04"},{"title":" Raspi-Config","shortTitle":"05","contentMd":"# Raspi-Config\r\n\r\nNow that you have connected to the RPi you can use the ``raspi-config`` utility to further configure the RPi.\r\n\r\n+ At the command prompt in the the RPi SSH session, enter ``sudo raspi-config``. This will show the following:   \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expand rootfs\r\nTypically, Raspberry Pi OS images are 2 GB. When you copy the image to a larger SD card then a large portion of the  card may be left unused. To make this available to Raspberry Pi OS, and the apps installed on the RPi, you can expand it to  fill the rest of the SD card.  \r\n\r\n+ In the Raspi-config tool, select Advanced Options->Expand Filesystem\r\n\r\n![Expand rootfs Partition](./img/expand-filesystem1.png)  \r\n\r\nYou should be informed that the resize will take place on the next reboot of the RPi.\r\n\r\n","route":"/lab/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-02/unit-1/book-3/05","id":"05"},{"title":" SenseHAT","shortTitle":"06","contentMd":"# SenseHAT\r\n\r\nIn this step you will mount the SenseHAT and run a simple program that uses the SenseHAT to take a temperature reading and make a simple decision (too hot, fine, too cold).\r\n\r\n## Before We Start...\r\n\r\n...lets make sure the RPi is up to date. In the RPi SSH session, run the following commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get upgrade\r\n```\r\nThis will download package information and install available upgrades of all packages currently installed on the system.\r\n\r\n## Attach the SenseHAT\r\n\r\nNever attach/remove the senseHAT while the RPi is powered up. Never attach/remove the senseHAT while the RPi is powered up (it's worth saying that twice that before we go on!).\r\n\r\nTo attach the SenseHAT, follow the guide [here](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/2)\r\n\r\n![Mounting the SenseHAT](https://projects-static.raspberrypi.org/projects/rpi-sensehat-attach/fb1c2ea53dbce821e4bc82f8f92d77075415053f/en/images/animated_sense_hat.gif)\r\n\r\n## Configure the RPi for SenseHAT\r\n\r\n- Power up the RPi with the SenseHAT attached. You may notice all the LEDs come on and stay on  - that's ok for now. \r\n\r\n- Start a SSH session on you Raspberry Pi. You can probably use the host name you configured in the last step now instead of the IP address.\r\n\r\n### Install SenseHAT package\r\n\r\n- Type this command into the terminal to install the Sense HAT package:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo apt-get install sense-hat\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Now reboot the RPi by entering ``sudo reboot`` in the SSH session. You will lose connection immediately. \r\n\r\n**Only if the LEDs stay on after the reboot**, enter the following command\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsudo nano /boot/config.txt\r\n```\r\n+ Scroll to the bottom of the file and append the following line(do not use any spaces around the \"=\" sign, enter it exactly as below):\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ndtoverlay=rpi-sense\r\n```\r\n\r\n+ Now press *Ctrl - O*, followed by *Enter* to Save. Then *Ctrl - X* to quit.\r\n\r\n+ Reboot the RPi again as above. The LEDs should turn off after the boot process has completed. \r\n\r\n## Create your 1st Python Program\r\n\r\n- Create a new directory called ``week6-lab2`` and change directory to it:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\npi@sensePi:~ $ mkdir week7-lab1\r\npi@sensePi:~ $ cd week7*\r\npi@sensePi:~/week7-lab1 $\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n- Using nano, create a new python script called ``temp-sensor.py`` and add the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sense_hat import SenseHat\r\n\r\nsense = SenseHat()\r\nsense.clear()\r\ngreen = (0, 255, 0)\r\nred = (255,0,0)\r\nwhile True:\r\n  temp = sense.get_temperature()\r\n  if temp >=25:\r\n    sense.show_message(\"HOT!\", text_colour = red)\r\n  else:\r\n    sense.show_message(\"Fine!\", text_colour = green)\r\n  print(temp)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Now run the the program by typing ``python temp-sensor.py`` at the command line. You should see output similar to the following:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\n~/cs-lab-5 $ python temp-sensor.py\r\n33.149307251\r\n33.1675720215\r\n33.2771759033\r\n33.3319740295\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nand your SenseHAT should be telling you if it's HOT! or Fine.\r\n\r\nLook at the code and try to understand the logic using what you learned in Programming. Some things of note with Python\r\n\r\n1. You use indent group statements in a program or script. For example, notice the  block of code contained in the ``while`` statement is indented.\r\n2. You don't have to compile it before you run it - it's an 'interpreted' language.\r\n3. Python is dynamically typed; you don't have to declare what type each variable is.  \r\n\r\n# Exercises \r\n\r\n- Change the above code and set the temperature threshold so that it changes the output on the SenseHAT(i.e. if it's ``HOT!``, make it display ``Fine``).\r\n- Notice how ``red`` and ``green`` variables are declared. Investigate and explain why.\r\n- Change the program to display everything in blue.\r\n- The temperature you're seeing is probably way off the ambient temp (certainly wasn't 33 Celsius when I tested it for this lab!) . Why do you think this is the case. Propose a solution to correcting this problem and implement it, if possible, in code.\r\n","route":"/lab/{{COURSEURL}}/topic-02/unit-1/book-3/06","id":"06"}]}]}]}],"properties":{"zoom":"https://zoom.us/","credits":"Dr Frank Walsh","ignorepin":1213,"auth":0,"ignore":null},"calendar":{"title":"IoT Standards and Protocols","weeks":[{"Mon Jan 15 2024 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Greenwich Mean Time)":{"title":0,"type":"Introdution"}}]}}
