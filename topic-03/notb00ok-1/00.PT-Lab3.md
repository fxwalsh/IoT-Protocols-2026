# APIs and Device Discovery

Use HTTP to control a device and SSDP to discover a device

## Introduction
You will use the  Raspberry Pi as prototype smart security light and sensor. You will implement a HTTP Web API that will expose routes that allow clients to connect, get sensor data, and send *commands* ,encoded in the URL query string, to the Raspberry Pi. 
You will also implement a discovery service on the RPi which allows clients to find and acquire it's IP address
